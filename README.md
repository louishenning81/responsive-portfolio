Overall I thought I got a good grasp of the media queries through this assignment. 

I'm still pretty frustrated at a very specific portion of the code that didn't seem to work.  Specifically, 

.work {
    width: 100%;
}

within my 640px media query wouldn't resize the image to take up the entire veitcal container even though it was correctly moving the images into a vertical row.  I still don't know why this wouldn't work.  This brings up a bigger issue that I found while working through this assignment.  I found that, while it was useful to bring in a template CSS to help me figure out which components needed adjusting, if I left the component parts of the original CSS on rather than adding them in increments as I needed them, I often had css commands working against eachother without knowing.  It's kind of like trying to push a car forward while it's reverse.  

It really would be nice to better understand hierarchy of what CSS code is working on specific HTML components at any given time.  Maybe, I need a tutorial in using the developer tools in my browser.  This might help.
